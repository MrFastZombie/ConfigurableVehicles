[mod-setting-description]
locomotive-enable=(Boolean) Enable locomotive customization.
locomotive-remote-driving=(Boolean) Enables the remote driving system added in Factorio 2.0.
locomotive-air-resistance=(Double) Air resistance for locomotive.
locomotive-braking-force=(Double) Braking force for locomotive.
locomotive-energy-per-hit=(Double) From the Factorio API documentation: "The (movement) energy used per hit point (1 hit point = 1 health damage) taken and dealt for this vehicle during collisions. The smaller the number, the more damage this vehicle and the rammed entity take during collisions: [color=#e69d16]damage = energy / energy_per_hit_point[/color]"
locomotive-friction=(Double) Friction for locomotive.
locomotive-max-health=(Int) Maximum health for locomotive.
locomotive-max-power=(Double) Maximum power for locomotive.
locomotive-max-speed=(Double) Maximum speed for locomotive.
locomotive-reverse-power-mod=(Double) When reversing, the train's power is multiplied by this value.
locomotive-weight=(Int) Weight for locomotive.
