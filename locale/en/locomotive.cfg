[mod-setting-description]
locomotive-air-resistance=Air resistance for locomotive.
locomotive-braking-force=Braking force for locomotive.
locomotive-energy-per-hit=From the Factorio API documentation: "The (movement) energy used per hit point (1 hit point = 1 health damage) taken and dealt for this vehicle during collisions. The smaller the number, the more damage this vehicle and the rammed entity take during collisions: [color=#e69d16]damage = energy / energy_per_hit_point[/color]"
locomotive-friction=Friction for locomotive.
locomotive-max-health=Maximum health for locomotive.
locomotive-max-power=Maximum power for locomotive.
locomotive-max-speed=Maximum speed for locomotive.
locomotive-reverse-power-mod=When reversing, the train's power is multiplied by this value.
locomotive-weight=Weight for locomotive.
