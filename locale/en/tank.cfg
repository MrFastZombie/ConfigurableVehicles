[mod-setting-description]
tank-enable=(Bool) Enable tank customization.
tank-rock-impact=Whether tanks should take damage when running into rocks.
tank-cliff-impact=Whether tanks should take damage when running into cliffs.
tank-tree-impact=Whether tanks should take damage when running into trees.
tank-health=(Int) Maximum health that tanks should have.
tank-weight=(Int) Weight that tanks should have.
tank-flamethrower-min-range=(Int) Minimum range that flamethrowers should have.
tank-flamethrower-range=(Int) Range that flamethrowers should have.
tank-flamethrower-damagemod=(Float) Modifier for flamethrower damage. 1 = Vanilla, 2 = 2x vanilla, etc.
tank-mg-range=(Int) Range that machine guns should have. 
tank-mg-damagemod=(Float) Modifier for machine gun damage. 1 = Vanilla, 2 = 2x vanilla, etc.
tank-cannon-range=(Int) Range that cannon should have. This doesn't seem to actually do much, as the range is based on the ammo. 
tank-cannon-damagemod=(Float)Modifier for cannon damage. 1 = Vanilla, 2 = 2x vanilla, etc.
tank-friction=(Double) Friction that tanks should have.
tank-effectivity=(Double) Effectivity that tanks should have. Effectivity is the efficiency of the burner's output to the wheels.
tank-energy-per-hit=(Double) From the Factorio API documentation: "The (movement) energy used per hit point (1 hit point = 1 health damage) taken and dealt for this vehicle during collisions. The smaller the number, the more damage this vehicle and the rammed entity take during collisions: [color=#e69d16]damage = energy / energy_per_hit_point[/color]"
tank-turret-rotation-speed=(Double) Rotation speed that tank turrets should have.
tank-rotation-speed=(Double) Rotation speed that tanks should have.
tank-braking-power=(Double) Braking power that tanks should have. Units like in the default are required.
tank-consumption=(Double) Fuel consumption in energy per second that tanks should have. Units like in the default are required.
tank-inventory-size=(Int) Inventory size in slots that tanks should have.
