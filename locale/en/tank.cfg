[mod-setting-description]
tank-rock-impact=Whether tanks should take damage when running into rocks.
tank-cliff-impact=Whether tanks should take damage when running into cliffs.
tank-tree-impact=Whether tanks should take damage when running into trees.
tank-health=Maximum health that tanks should have.
tank-weight=Weight that tanks should have.
tank-flamethrower-range=Range that flamethrowers should have.
tank-flamethrower-damagemod=Modifier for flamethrower damage. 1 = Vanilla, 2 = 2x vanilla, etc.
tank-mg-range=Range that machine guns should have. 
tank-mg-damagemod=Modifier for machine gun damage. 1 = Vanilla, 2 = 2x vanilla, etc.
tank-cannon-range=Range that cannon should have. 
tank-cannon-damagemod=Modifier for cannon damage. 1 = Vanilla, 2 = 2x vanilla, etc.
tank-insert-cannon=Adds a cannon to the tank. Only use if your tank is missing it unless you want two.
tank-insert-flamethrower=Adds a flamethrower to the tank. Only use if your tank is missing it unless you want two.
tank-insert-machine-gun=Adds a machine gun to the tank. Only use if your tank is missing it unless you want two.
tank-friction=Friction that tanks should have.
tank-effectivity=Effectivity that tanks should have. Effectivity is the efficiency of the burner's output to the wheels.
tank-energy-per-hit=From the Factorio API documentation: "The (movement) energy used per hit point (1 hit point = 1 health damage) taken and dealt for this vehicle during collisions. The smaller the number, the more damage this vehicle and the rammed entity take during collisions: [color=#e69d16]damage = energy / energy_per_hit_point[/color]"
tank-turret-rotation-speed=Rotation speed that tank turrets should have.
tank-rotation-speed=Rotation speed that tanks should have.
tank-braking-power=Braking power that tanks should have. Units like in the default are required.
tank-consumption=Fuel consumption in energy per second that tanks should have. Units like in the default are required.
