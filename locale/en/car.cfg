[mod-setting-description]
car-rock-impact=Whether cars should take damage when running into rocks.
car-cliff-impact=Whether cars should take damage when running into cliffs.
car-tree-impact=Whether cars should take damage when running into trees.
car-health=Maximum health that cars should have.
car-weight=Weight that cars should have.
car-mg-range=Range that machine guns should have. 
car-mg-damagemod=Modifier for machine gun damage. 1 = Vanilla, 2 = 2x vanilla, etc.
car-energy-per-hit=From the Factorio API documentation: "The (movement) energy used per hit point (1 hit point = 1 health damage) taken and dealt for this vehicle during collisions. The smaller the number, the more damage this vehicle and the rammed entity take during collisions: [color=#e69d16]damage = energy / energy_per_hit_point[/color]"
car-effectivity=Effectivity that cars should have. Effectivity is the efficiency of the burner's output to the wheels.
car-friction=Friction that cars should have.
car-turret-rotation-speed=Rotation speed that car turrets should have.
