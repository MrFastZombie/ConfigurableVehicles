[mod-setting-description]
car-enable=(Bool) Enable car customization.
car-remote-driving=(Bool) Enables the remote driving system added in Factorio 2.0.
car-rock-impact=(Bool) Whether cars should take damage when running into rocks.
car-cliff-impact=(Bool) Whether cars should take damage when running into cliffs.
car-tree-impact=(Bool) Whether cars should take damage when running into trees.
car-sort-inventory=(Bool) Whether cars should sort their inventory automatically.
car-health=(Int) Maximum health that cars should have.
car-weight=(Int) Weight that cars should have.
car-mg-range=(Int) Range that machine guns should have. 
car-mg-damagemod=(Float) Modifier for machine gun damage. 1 = Vanilla, 2 = 2x vanilla, etc.
car-energy-per-hit=(Double) From the Factorio API documentation: "The (movement) energy used per hit point (1 hit point = 1 health damage) taken and dealt for this vehicle during collisions. The smaller the number, the more damage this vehicle and the rammed entity take during collisions: [color=#e69d16]damage = energy / energy_per_hit_point[/color]"
car-effectivity=(Double) Effectivity that cars should have. Effectivity is the efficiency of the burner's output to the wheels.
car-friction=(Double) Friction that cars should have.
car-turret-rotation-speed=(Double) Rotation speed that car turrets should have.
car-braking-power=(Double) Braking power that cars should have. Units like in the default are required.
car-consumption=(Double) Fuel consumption in energy per second that cars should have. Units like in the default are required.
car-inventory-size=(Int) Inventory size in slots that cars should have.
car-trash-inventory-size=(Int) Trash inventory size in slots that cars should have.
